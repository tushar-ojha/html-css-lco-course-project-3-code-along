## Learnings from the project:-

- In media query, min-height or min-width means this is the minimum criteria to work. Media query will start working from this point.

- max-width or max-height means this is the upper limit. Media query will not work above that.

- Tip to remember: 
  ### min means start from here and max means end here!!!
